 * This is why you will see double being used any time accuracy is important,

 * In general, the program takes a double and a float and adds 0.1 
 * to each over and over again numOfLoops times. So if you set it to 1000000, 
 * that means itâ€™s adding 0.1 ten times, or 0.1 x 1000000 so the output would be 100000.0. 
 * float and double both give you this value, 
 * but keep making numOfLoops higher and a float will start to give unexpected results, 
 * showing their lower precision and rounding issues.
